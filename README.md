# Final Project: "Passing Pixels: An Interactive Low-Resolution LED Display"
"Passing Pixels" is an interactive art setup that turns the movement of people walking by into fun pixel art on a low-resolution LED screen. 
It uses a camera that senses motion to capture video and change it into pixelated images shown on LED panels. This project makes it fun to play and changes how we see shapes and movement, letting viewers watch their animated, pixelated outlines in real-time. 


The inspiration for "Passing Pixels" came from a cool LED display at San Diego International Airport by artist Jim Campbell, called "The Journey". 
In this setup, figures look like they are swimming through 40,000 LED glass spheres hanging above, drawing the attention of people walking underneath. 
Campbell's artwork uses simple, low-res displays to show figures in a basic, straightforward way. This inspired us to make something similar but with a twist: making it interactive. 
"Passing Pixels" takes this idea further by not just showing fixed figures but by turning the live movements of people into fun pixel art. This makes playing with the artwork more personal and fun.
